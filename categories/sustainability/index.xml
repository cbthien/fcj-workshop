&lt;p>Climate tech startups are companies that use technology and innovation to address the climate crisis, with a primary focus on either reducing greenhouse gas emissions or helping society adapt to climate change impacts. Their unifying mission is to create scalable solutions that accelerate the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future. Solutions to the climate crisis are ever more important as climate-driven extreme weather disasters increase globally. In 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.ajg.com/gallagherre/-/media/files/gallagher/gallagherre/news-and-insights/2025/natural-catastrophe-and-climate-report-2025.pdf">climate disasters caused more than $417B in damages&lt;/a> globally, and there’s no slowing down in 2025 with &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-wildfires-natural-disasters-losses-insurance-recovery-d2f24e44d75503118643151eaee947fb">LA wildfires that destroyed more than $135B&lt;/a> in the first month of the year alone. Climate tech startups are at the forefront of building impactful solutions to the climate crisis, and they’re using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/">generative AI&lt;/a> to build as quickly as possible.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

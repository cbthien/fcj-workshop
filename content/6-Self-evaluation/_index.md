During my internship at **Amazon Web Services, Inc.** from **September 6, 2025** to **December 9, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired at school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in the **Internal Learning Chatbot Project**, through which I improved my skills in **programming, analysis, and reporting**. In terms of work ethic, I consistently tried to complete tasks effectively, follow company policies, and actively communicate with teammates to enhance work efficiency.

### Blog 1 - FotMob delivers near real-time football updates to millions of fans with AWS
The article describes how FotMob – a soccer app with over 17 million users across 500 leagues – uses AWS infrastructure to deliver near-real-time updates to fans. FotMob’s system has to handle extremely high volumes, with billions of push notifications per week and up to 1.6 million HTTP requests per second during peak hours. They previously used a third-party push notification system but couldn’t handle the load, so they built an in-house notification system on AWS, which is both reliable and saves over $130,000 per year.
### Blog 2 - Accelerating the next wave of generative AI startups
AWS has announced a $230 million investment commitment to accelerate the wave of startups developing Generative AI applications globally. Amazon Web Services, Inc. Along with that, they reintroduced the AWS Generative AI Accelerator program — a 10-week (hybrid) program, in partnership with NVIDIA, to support potential startups: this year the program expanded fourfold, serving up to 80 global startups, each receiving up to $1 million in AWS credits to develop, scale, and innovate.
### Blog 3 - How climate tech startups are building foundation models with Amazon SageMaker HyperPod
Climate-tech startups are leveraging Amazon SageMaker HyperPod to build specialized foundation models using large, multimodal environmental datasets from satellite imagery, climate data, to geological data to address problems such as carbon capture, sustainable material design, local weather and climate prediction, ecosystem conservation, and geological mapping. HyperPod provides a powerful AI infrastructure: automated provisioning of a GPU cluster with thousands of units, monitoring, fault-tolerance, checkpointing, and autoscaling making large-scale computations fast, reliable, and cost effective. Startups like Orbital Materials and Hum.AI have successfully developed their own models for carbon capture material design and ecosystem analysis clearly demonstrating how HyperPod is expanding the capabilities of environmental AI, turning complex data into sustainable solutions.

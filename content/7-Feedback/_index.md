### General Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at FCJ is comfortable and highly supportive. Team members are always willing to help whenever I face difficulties, even outside of working hours. The clean and organized workspace also makes it easier for me to stay focused during work.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provided very dedicated guidance, always explaining clearly whenever I didn’t understand something and encouraging me to ask questions to broaden my thinking. The team admin also supported me with procedures and provided essential documents. What I appreciate most is that my mentor allowed me to explore and solve problems on my own instead of giving the answer immediately, helping me grow in problem-solving skills.

**3. Alignment Between Work and Academic Background**  
The tasks assigned to me were aligned with what I learned in my academic program, while also exposing me to new areas that I had not had the chance to explore before. This allowed me to strengthen my foundational knowledge while gaining practical skills relevant to the field.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
Throughout the internship, I gained many new skills such as using project management tools, collaborating within a team, and communicating in a professional environment. My mentor also shared valuable insights and real-world experience that helped me better define my career direction.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture at FCJ is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still maintains a cheerful atmosphere. The team collaborates closely and supports one another, which made me feel welcomed and truly part of the group, even as an intern.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**  
The company provides internship allowances and offers flexible working hours when needed. Being able to participate in internal training sessions is also a big plus, helping me improve my skills and better understand the workplace culture.

**7. What did you **like the most** during your internship?**  
What I appreciated the most was the friendly working environment and the dedicated support from my mentor. I always felt encouraged to try, make mistakes, and learn from them without pressure. This helped me gain more confidence in problem-solving and developing my professional skills.

**8. What do you think the company should **improve** for future interns?**  
I believe the company could develop an updated onboarding document specifically for interns to help them get up to speed more quickly during the initial period.

**9. If you introduce this program to your friends, would you recommend they intern here? Why ?** 

I would definitely recommend this internship to my friends. The environment here is ideal for those who want to learn while gaining real-world experience. The FCJ mentor team is very supportive and always creates opportunities for interns to grow instead of simply assigning tasks one-way.
